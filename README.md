# Flight-Price-Prediction

The main goal of this project is to create a strong model that can predict flight ticket prices accurately. This will help passengers know the best time to book flights and also assist airlines in making smarter decisions about pricing. It's important for both travelers and airlines to have reliable predictions for flight costs

## Data Source
In this project, we use flight data we got from Kaggle. This data has important information like flight prices, airline details, departure and arrival times, and more. We've divided this data into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set helps our model learn, and the test set is used to see how well the model performs.
