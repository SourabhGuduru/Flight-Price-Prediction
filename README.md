# Flight-Price-Prediction

The main goal of this project is to create a strong model that can predict flight ticket prices accurately. This will help passengers know the best time to book flights and also assist airlines in making smarter decisions about pricing. It's important for both travelers and airlines to have reliable predictions for flight costs

## Data Source
In this project, we use flight data we got from Kaggle. This data has important information like flight prices, airline details, departure and arrival times, and more. We've divided this data into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set helps our model learn, and the test set is used to see how well the model performs.

## Preprocessing Steps
Before constructing our predictive model, it's vital to prepare and refine the dataset. This involves several key preprocessing steps to ensure the data's suitability for accurate predictions. The following procedures are performed as part of the dataset preprocessing:

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:** We start by importing essential Python libraries that facilitate data manipulation. These libraries enable us to work with the data efficiently.

2. **Loading Data into Pandas Dataframes:** The training and test datasets are loaded into Pandas dataframes. This step provides a structured and organized way to handle the data.

3. **Combining Datasets:** To perform comprehensive data analysis, we merge the training and test datasets into a unified dataframe. This combination allows us to consider the entire dataset as a whole.

4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Cleaning and transforming the data are crucial steps. We remove any missing values, irrelevant columns, and convert string values into numeric representations. This process ensures that the data is consistent and ready for modeling.

5. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** To make the data compatible with the model, we encode categorical variables into numerical representations. This step is essential because many machine learning algorithms require numeric input data.

These preprocessing steps are vital in preparing the dataset for building an accurate flight price prediction model. They help ensure that the data is in the right format and ready for analysis and modeling.
